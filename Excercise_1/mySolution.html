    <!-- Here is where I found a bug. 
    The original had every input as type "text".
    This must be changed to type "number".
    If we left at as text, than letters and characters can be entered into the inputs and our function does not account for that, 
    this would confuse the end-users of this application. 
    For example, if I was an end-user, I may think that this application 
    would let me enter a bunch of alphabet letters and tell me which letter appears the most.
    In actuality, it is meant to calculate average of integers only.  Hence why I change it to "number"  -->
    Enter numbers to get the average:
    <br />1. <input type="number" size="10" />
    <br />2. <input type="number" size="10" />
    <br />3. <input type="number" size="10" />
    <br />4. <input type="number" size="10" />
    <br />5. <input type="number" size="10" />
    <br />6. <input type="number" size="10" />
    <br />7. <input type="number" size="10" />
    <br />8. <input type="number" size="10" />
    <br />9. <input type="number" size="10" />
    <br />10. <input type="number" size="10" />
